# Introduction

## What is PyTorch

**PyTorch** is an open-source framework for machine-learning.
It is developed by **Facebook AI Research** ( **Meta** ).
This framework is mostly used to build and train **Deep Learning** models.
Because of its flexibility and **Pythonic inference**, it has become so popular,
specially among researchers.
To understand **PyTorch**, first, we should understand **Deep Learning**.

## What is Deep learning

**Deep Learning** is a branch of **Machine learning**.
In **Deep Learning** we teach computers on how to perform a task by learning **patterns** in **data**.
The reason it is called **Deep Learning** because we stack so many layers on **neurons**.
